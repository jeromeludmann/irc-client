# Get ready

## Prerequisites

Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) first.

For a better developer experience, it would be better to have [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/) (but it's not required).

## Project installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jeromeludmann/irc-client
cd irc-client
npm install
```

_Note that `npm install` will also generate coverage report._

# Development workflow

## Tasks

| task                                   | command                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Run compilation                        | `npm run build`               |
| Run compilation in watch mode          | `npm run build:watch`         |
| Run unit tests                         | `npm run test`                |
| Run unit tests in watch mode           | `npm run test:watch`          |
| Open a browser and check test coverage | `npm run test:check-coverage` |
| Start the application                  | `npm start`                   |

## Run a local ircd

First make sure you have [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/).

This command below allows you to run a local ircd on your machine:

```sh
./ircd up
```

It will be accessible from **localhost** port **6667**.

For instance, after running the app, you can connect it with `/connect localhost`.

## UI behaviors

- Auto scroll on message receiving
- Auto focus input on window switching
- Set caret after the last character on back/forward input history
- Nicklist full implementation (actions, reducers, components)

## UI themes

- Add one and make it themable

## Tests

- Add additional tests for sagas

## Performances

- Buffer messages by limiting nodes in DOM in order to avoid performance issues

# Codebase best practices

Project recommendation and best practices.

_WIP_

## Keep reducers and selectors together

Since they are tightly coupled, keep reducers and related selectors together:

```
state
├── route
│   ├── reducer.ts
│   └── selectors.ts
└── server
    ├── reducer.ts
    └── selectors.ts
```

## UI theming

_WIP_
